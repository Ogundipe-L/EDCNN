# EDCNN
### Ensemble Deep Neural Networks integrating genomics and histopathological images for predicting stages and survival time-to-event in colon cancer.

Salient and complementary features are extracted from histopathological whole slide images (WSI) and genomics (mRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation) expression. Colon cancer stages prediction estimated with DNN model using (1) image features (2) genomics (3) integrated features as input into predictive model. The result from each features compare and contrast.  Also, extracted features tested on its capacity to stratify the samples into low or high risk survival groups
