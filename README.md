# EDCNN
Ensemble Deep Neural Networks integrating genomics and histopathological images for predicting stages and survival time-to-event in colon cancer
We extract and integrate complementary features from histopathological whole slide images, genomics (mRNA, miRNA and DNA methylation). Then we experiment and compare colon cancer stages predictive accuracy when (1) images features was used as input into our predictive model (2) integrated features from genomics used as input features and (3)  integrated features from images and genomics was used as input features.
